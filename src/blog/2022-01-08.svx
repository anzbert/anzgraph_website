I've been learning ReactJS for a little while with a few resources that I can definitely recommend:

| Book                                                                                                   | By                       |

| [Learning React (2nd Edition)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-react-2nd/9781492051718/) | Alex Banks, Eve Porcello |
| [Road to React (2021 Edition](https://www.roadtoreact.com/)                                            | Robin Wieruch            |

And here is what I quickly put together as a practice project. A fictitious trading card generator with cat pictures and cat facts. [Click here to have a look ðŸ˜½ !](https://anzbert.github.io/vite_react_test/dist/)

I may or may not update / finish it, potentially adding some additional functionality and design tweaks. Maybe not though ðŸ˜›. So many other things to do!

Otherwise, to anyone actually reading this....

### Happy New Year!
