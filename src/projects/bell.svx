# Wireless Bus Bell

---

## Background

Two of my dear friends bought an old street bus. Even better, they actually bought a former [O-Bahn Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-Bahn_Busway) from South Australia. This beauty featured a massive bell to be binged when a stop was requested. Unfortunately, it needed to be removed during the full renovation.

I scored this nice collector's piece at the time, but it seemed appropriate to eventually return it to its original home and give it a purpose as a door bell again.

## The Build

### Materials

- 1x Arduino Pro Micro
- 1x Box made from MDF
- 1x Crappy wireless door bell remote from a hardware store kit (Bunnings)
- 1x Superheterodyne RF433Mhz receiver module (RX470-4)
- 1x Resistor 470 Ohm between arduino and RF433 module
- 1x Logic level transistor
- 1x Bus Bell (using a solenoid as the hammer)
- 1x Diode (as '_flywheel_ diode' for solenoid)
- 1x 12v to 5v transformer
- 1x 12v power supply
- 1x Cables and PCB

This project relies heavily on the excellent [RF433any](https://github.com/sebmillet/RF433any) library, which made it a breeze to intercept and decipher the cheap bell remote's signal. When a signal is intercepted, the bell solenoid is activated briefly through a logic level transistor.

The biggest challenge was to get the 433Mhz receiver to function reliably when sharing power with the Arduino. I suspect the first RF module I used (MX-FS-03V) was quite sensitive to import power fluctuations. I did not have an oscilloscope to confirm this theory, neither did I have a bunch of capacitors at home to try to fix the issue through some kind of filtering circuit. The easiest solution, that worked without any further drama, was to use a higher quality, so called "superheterodyne" RF module (RX470-4). The range was much better with this unit and the bell can now be activated with perfect reliability. I call this a win! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥‚
